# Particle system interactive simulator

## Introduction
The Particle System Interactive Simulator is an interactive web-based application for simulating and visualizing the behavior of particle systems. This project uses HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript to create a dynamic particle environment that allows users to explore the characteristics of complex systems by adjusting various parameters.

Check out the demo [here](https://quantumwings.github.io/Basic-particle-interactive-control-panel/).

## Main functions
-Dynamic particle generation and motion simulation
- Visualization of connection lines between particles
- Mouse interaction effects
- Adjustable particle number, size, connection distance and speed
- Colorful particle display
- Boundary collision handling

## Installation and Setup Guide

### Environmental requirements
- Modern web browser (supports HTML5 and JavaScript)
- Web server (optional, for local hosting)

### How to use
1. Download the project file to a local directory.
2. Use a web server to host the index.html file, or open the file directly in your browser.

## Instructions for use

### Operation steps
1. After opening the application, you will see a screen full of dynamic particles.
2. Use the control panel in the upper left corner to adjust simulation parameters:
 - Adjust the "Number of Particles" slider to increase or decrease particles.
 - Use the Particle Size slider to change the visual size of particles.
 - "Connection distance" controls the maximum distance between particles.
 - "Particle Speed" adjusts the movement speed of particles.
3. Move the mouse on the screen and observe the reaction of the particles to the mouse position.

### Example
- Set a high number of particles (e.g. 3000) and a small connection distance (e.g. 50) to simulate a dense network.
- Use low particle numbers (e.g. 500) and large particle sizes (e.g. 5.0) to observe individual behavior.
- Turn up particle speed (e.g. 3.0) to simulate high energy systems.

## Other information
The particle system simulation for this project is based on multiple physical and mathematical concepts, including kinematics, collision mechanics, and network theory. It provides a visual platform that can be used to study complex systems, statistical physics, and data visualization. Future development directions may include adding more physics models, optimizing performance to support larger-scale simulations, and integrating machine learning algorithms to analyze particle behavior patterns.
